</p>
<p>(d)	There are risks and limitations associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software, and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet.

</p>
<p>(e)	A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of the ECIO Space ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of NFTs.
</p>
<p>(f)	The current state of regulations regarding blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain. When new regulations or policies are introduced, they may materially adversely affect the development of the ECIO Space ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of NFTs.
